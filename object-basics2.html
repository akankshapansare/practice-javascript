<!--
In our next task, we want you to have a go at creating your own object literal to represent one of your favourite bands. 
The required members are:

name: A string representing the band name.
nationality: A string representing the country the band comes from.
genre: What type of music the band plays.
members: A number representing the number of members the band has.
formed: A number representing the year the band formed.
split: A number representing the year the band split up, or false if they are still together.
albums: An array representing the albums released by the band. Each array item should be an object containing the following members:
name: A string representing the name of the album.
released: A number representing the year the album was released.
Include at least two albums in the albums array.
Once you've done this, you should then write a string to the variable bandInfo, 
which will contain a small biography detailing their name, nationality, years active, and style, 
and the title and release date of their first album.
