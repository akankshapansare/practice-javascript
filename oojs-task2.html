<!--Next, we'd like you to start with the Shape class you created in the last task.

We'd like you to create a Square class that inherits from Shape, and adds a calcArea() method that calculates the square's area.

Create an instance of the Square called square with appropriate property values, and call its calcPerimeter() and calcArea() methods to show that it works. -->
